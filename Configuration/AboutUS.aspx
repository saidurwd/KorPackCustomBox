                    With over 16 years of comprehensive and analytical experience in the packaging industry, President and Founder of Korpack, Nick Novy, applies his knowledge to every customer that comes through the door. Nick earned his degree in Packaging Engineering from Michigan State University and, after sharpening his skills as a consultant, he decided to pursue a career working hand-in-hand with customers, sharing his knowledge and continually growing from new challenges and projects.
    <br />
                    <br />
                    After graduating, Nick went on to work for  for the largest stock packaging distributor in the country. In the time he spent there, he came to understand the needs of his customers down to the minute detail, and realized that, to truly help them, he needed to present customers with custom options and other non-stock supplies, as well as full-service consultation, to make the best packaging decision for their company.
    <br />
                    <br />
                    This spark of realization is what led to the creation of Korpack and continues to burn brightly at the core of the company. Nick and his handpicked team of well-versed and dedicated individuals work to always exceed customer’s expectations.
